CHANGES:
========

ElementAttributes
-----------------
* Change the way keyword/value pair is delimited with quotes.

BUG REPORTS ADDRESSED:
=====================

ConcreteElement
---------------
* Changed output so that the current element encoding type is used when the element 
  is outputted to an OutputStream.
* Fixed potential problem with PrintWriter not flushing. 
* Fixed end of line handling while pretty printing, so that
it is correctly uses the line.separator system property to determine end of
line, instead of using a hard coded '\n'.

Document
--------
* There are some errors in the code of this class. They are the same kind of errors that I found in
org.apache.ecs.Document. The problem is mainly in the setXXX methods (setBody for example), which forgets to
update the local reference AND the reference in the Hashtable.
* Fixed NPE on null doctype

ElementAttributes
-----------------
* Fixed bug when addAttribute is used with an int, Integer or Object as an attribute value.

FrameSetDocument
----------------
* Fixed some errors in the code of this class. The problem was mainly in the setXXX methods
  (setBody for example), which forgets to update the local reference AND the reference 
  in the Hashtable. 

GenericElement
--------------
* International character set bug fix

DOMFactory
----------
* Change DOMFactory so that it doesn't use Piped*Streams to prevent potential deadlocks.

Script
------
* Changed script so that the body is not outputted when the src attribute is set.

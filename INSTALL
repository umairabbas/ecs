Element Construction Set (ECS)
------------------------------

+--------------+
| Installation |
+--------------+

Installation of the default distribution of ECS is simple. All one needs to 
do is copy the ecs.jar file into the CLASSPATH's where it is used.


+----------+
| Building |
+----------+

To build ECS from source code, we depend on the Ant build system. This is 
documented in build/README.
